This is a sample, written in java, for playing poker against the oorby.com API.

This code has a dependency on JSON-java, available here:
https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java

After compiling the source, you can run BotRunner with:
java com.oorby.poker.BotRunner botName devkey

BotRunner is currently hardcoded to use SimpleBot, which randomly takes an action. You can add your own poker logic by creating your own implementation of the Bot interface and using that in BotRunner.
